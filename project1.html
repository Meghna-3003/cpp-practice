    <p><strong>Learning Attitude</strong></p>
    <section><main>I believe consistent growth is more important than instant perfection. As a first-year CSE student, I approach every new topic with curiosity, discipline, and a beginnerâ€™s mindset. I donâ€™t fear making mistakesâ€”instead, I see them as an opportunity to understand concepts more deeply.
    Iâ€™m committed to building my skills step by stepâ€”starting with strong fundamentals in C++, web development, and problem-solving. I prefer learning by doing: writing code, building projects, and applying what I learn practically.
    I actively seek feedback, love teaching others what I know, and believe in lifelong learning. My goal is to become not just job-ready but industry-readyâ€”with the ability to adapt, learn fast, and solve real-world problems.
